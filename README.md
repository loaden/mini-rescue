To build an ISO image from within Debian Linux:

  1. `git clone git@github.com:loaden/mini-rescue.git`
  2. `cd mini-rescue`
  3. `sudo ./make`

After building, it's easy to modify a file or install a package without rebuilding and downloading all the packages again:

  1. `sudo ./make changes`
  1. Make your changes to the live system image
  1. `exit` and the ISO will be updated automatically

It is possible to change the mirror of the source, add extra packages, or both:

  1. `sudo MIRROR=https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/debian ./make`
  2. `sudo EXTRA_PACKAGES=fonts-noto-cjk ./make`
  3. `sudo MIRROR=https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/debian EXTRA_PACKAGES=fonts-noto-cjk ./make`
